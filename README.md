<h2><strong>🙍‍♂️・About Me</strong></h2>

👋 Hello, I'm Murtatrxx, xxDeveloper. My timezone is <a href="https://24timezones.com/time-zone/gmt+3">GMT+3</a>. I'm experienced Roblox LUA scripter about 2 years. I'm trying to be as active as I can be (3-4 hours/day), I can work up to 😯 <strong>37</strong> hours per week (this is my record - <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/week/2021/5/6?pli=1">05.06.2021</a>). I am accepting short-term or medium-term jobs because I am already in a long-term project. Do you need a scripter why are you waiting, <strong>hire me!</strong>
